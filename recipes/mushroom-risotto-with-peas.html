    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 cups canned low-salt chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2-ounce dried porcini mushrooms</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups finely chopped onions</li>
        <li>10 ounces white mushrooms, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice or short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>2/3 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>3/4 cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
        <li>2/3 cup grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the broth to a simmer in a heavy medium saucepan. Add the porcini mushrooms. Set aside until the mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Keep the broth warm over very low heat.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add olive oil. Add the onions and saute until tender, about 8 minutes. Add the white mushrooms and garlic. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the porcini mushrooms to a cutting board. Finely chop the mushrooms and add to the saucepan. Saute until the mushrooms are tender and the juices evaporate, about 5 minutes. Stir in the rice and let it toast for a few minutes. Add the wine; cook until the liquid is absorbed, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of hot broth; simmer over medium-low heat until the liquid is absorbed, stirring often, about 3 minutes. Continue to cook until the rice is just tender and the mixture is creamy, adding more broth by cupfuls and stirring often, about 28 minutes (the rice will absorb 6 to 8 cups of broth). Stir in the peas. Mix in the Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
